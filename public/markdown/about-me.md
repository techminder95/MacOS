# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I'm a ~~dragon lost in human world~~ [Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) master's student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in [Software Engineering](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/).

I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

My current research interests lie primarily in exploring the capability of machine learning systems to be continuous, generalizable, and efficient, like continual learning, meta-learning, and parameter sharing. I'm also interested in efficiency of vision-language and video models.

I'm also learning to build machine learning softwares and systems. I'm also learning TypeScript, React and Vue.
