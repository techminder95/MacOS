# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I'm Xiaohan Zou, ~~a dragon lost in human world~~ now an intern at CETC and a research assistant at Peking University. Before that, I got my bachelor's degree in [Software Engineering](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

Research-wise, I'm mainly working on topics related to exploring the capability of machines to develop intelligent behavior upon what they have learned, like meta-learning and continual learning.
